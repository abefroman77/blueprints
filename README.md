## Philips Zigbee Tap Dial Switch
Control up to 4 sets of lights with on-off and dimmer control. Set an optional minimum brightness to prevent the light from turning off while dimming. Set an optional maximum brightness for dimming. Choose an optional on/off script for each light (i.e., turn on with set or variable brightness, color temp, etc. when light is off, turn off when light is on), or use the default toggle command.
